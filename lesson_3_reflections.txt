Why would you want to create a remote repositry than keep all your files local?
To create a backup of work
To share with others and let others improve your existing work
For recognition
To have a copy of work whererver you go (As long as you have internet access)

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When we want to move from one place to another
In a company for fast and easy access
Faster development process

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Allows for better control of versions of a given software
A commit that is pushed automatically may not be "big-enough" to be updated automatically
Puts you in charge and easier to make the decisions


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
A fork is github creating a similar copy automatically in your remote repositry
A clone is git creating a similar copy of files to where you specify it
A branch is when a repositry has multiple chains of commits emerging from previous commits in the main "master branch"

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
