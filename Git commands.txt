cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one, like code for VS code)
pwd                           # print working directory - shows what directory you are in
ls                            # list the files in this directory
diff			              # will only show you that the two files are different
scp                           # stands for secure copy from one pc to another (Or even the same PC)

Cloning a Repository
To clone a repository, run git clone followed by a space and the repository URL. Ex: git clone http://....../

Exiting git log
To stop viewing git log output, press q (which stands for quit).

Getting Colored Output
To get colored diff output, run git config --global color.ui auto

Copying and Pasting from the Command Line
To complete this quiz, you'll want to copy and paste some commit ids.

Windows
To copy and paste within Git Bash, follow the instructions on this page.

Mac
To copy and paste within the terminal on Mac, use Cmd+C and Cmd+V

Ubuntu
To copy and paste within the terminal on Ubuntu, use Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V.

Using git log and git diff
As a reminder, running git log will show a list of the recent commits with information about them, including commit IDs. Running git diff followed by two commit IDs will compare the two versions of the code in those commits. If you need a refresher, you may want to rewatch this video.

Entering commit IDs
If it is easier, you may enter the first four or more characters of the commit ID rather than pasting the entire ID.

Very close! The only thing you missed is that it actually is possible to copy a directory from 
one computer to another using the command scp.  That wasn't covered in the previous lesson, though, so you weren't expected to know it.
